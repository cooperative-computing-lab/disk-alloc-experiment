This repository contains the source code necessary to test loop device performance 
compared to the native filesystem's performance. In particular, it captures the
read/write throughput, file metadata speed, and creation/deletion overhead.

Contained is also a technical paper which analyzes the results obtained on the 
original test platform as well as the mechanics of implementing loop devices for
batch system task storage constraint.

This program requires superuser access for a few of its operations. If possible, 
please prepend 'sudo' to your call to the Makefile.

Here is a list of required programs to run the Makefile:
git
ar
perl
gnuplot
epstopdf
pdflatex

Here is the kernel version of the test platform and the filesystems used in the test:
Linux 2.6.32-504.16.2.el6.x86_64
ext2
ext3
ext4

You are more than welcome to add more filesystems to test in the benchmark.c program 
found in the ./src/ directory. Please let us know what you find!

To run all loop device experiments please run: make

To run only the read, write, and file metadata experiments please run: make performance

To run only the creation and deletion overhead experiments please run: make overhead

To clean only the final graphs and paper please run: make lean

To completely clean the experiments please run: make clean
